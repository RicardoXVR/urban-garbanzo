        <h3>"What is a 'Sleeper Agent'?"</h3>
            <p class="paragraphs">A sleeper agent is a spy who is placed in a target country/ organization way before their mission begins. This allows them to blend in, passively collect intelligence and become potential assets once activated by the entity that deployed them.
                <br>
                They are essentially living and breathing trump cards, and having them in the field might be the difference between <b>victory and defeat</b>.

        <h3>"So, what does this have to do with birds?"</h3>
            <p class="paragraphs">I don't blame you if this question popped in your head quickly after reading that birds are agents, but stay with me.
                <br>
                As you may have noticed, there are huge flocks of them everywhere you go. And I mean <b>EVERYWHERE!</b></p>
                <br>
            <ul>
                <li class="paragraphs">In the sky</li>
                <li class="paragraphs">On top of trees.</li>
                <li class="paragraphs">On top of buildings.</li>
                <li class="paragraphs">On the ground.</li>
                <li class="paragraphs">INSIDE HOMES!</li>
            </ul>
                <br>
                <p class="paragraphs">Do you know another species as omnipresent as birds? Didn't think so. And I wasn't kidding about the birds inside homes!
                <br>
                If you aren't one to willingly put birds as "pets" inside your own home (which will act as a CCTV, except you're not the one receiving the video feed!) then I congratulate you, but alas still have sad news for you.
                <br>
                See, many have fallen victim of these so called "birds" flying into their homes. This act of desperation to pry into your private life is sometimes a last-resort manoeuvre from them, so make sure that you are prepared to fight this behavior by adopting a feline friend.
                <br>
                The bottom line is: Sleeper agents are always conveniently placed somewhere where it allows them to take action whenever necessary in a blink of an eye, and what is more convenient than being everywhere at the same time? Their network is insanely large!</p>

        <h3>"Well, do you have any proof?"</h3>
            <p class="paragraphs">I know that by now you almost cannot take the anticipation, and that you are at the edge of your seat. I would like to honour that by saying that I like to be prepared with some evidence before making serious claims. Whether these birds are here waiting for a signal to end the human race because we are taking their families and feeding on them, or if they have some other ulterior reason, I'm not sure. It could very well be that they seek world domination for all I know.
                What I am sure of is that they are out there watching us and sharpening their knifes. And by knives I mean their 5.56x45mm NATO, air-cooled, gas-operated, direct impingement, magazine-fed, select fire M4A1 carbines (their loadouts vasty vary, but this is one to be wary of!).

                <p class="paragraphs">Convinced yet? As you can see each one of them have become one with their environments, so they go unnoticed to the untrained eye, but we can see beyond what meets the eye. Take care, and remember: They are watching. Prepare for the worst!</p>
