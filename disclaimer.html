            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p class="paragraphs">Hello! My name is Ricardo Xavier and thank you for taking the time to visit the website and read about me. I'm 28 years old and I'm from Portugal. I moved to the United Kingdom four years ago.
            I fell in love with I.T. a long time ago, but I wish I had tried to understand how it works at a deeper lever earlier, but here I am nonetheless, having written simple programs and built my first website - the one which you are now visiting.
            I aspire to learn even more about coding, eventually being able to write complex programs, and hopefully work professionally in the field.
            My hobbies involve playing video games, watching series and anime and travelling.
